# Student Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Contact Driver Button**: Was redirecting to email instead of initiating a phone call
2. **Real-time Updates**: Required manual refresh to display live status

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Contact Driver Button Fix
**File**: `src/pages/StudentDashboard.tsx`

**Change**: Modified the onClick handler to use `tel:` protocol instead of `mailto:`

**Result**: Clicking "Contact Driver" now initiates a phone call directly

### 2. Real-time Updates Enhancement
**Files**: 
- `src/pages/StudentDashboard.tsx`
- `src/context/BusContext.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced Firebase listener with improved connection monitoring
- Added periodic UI refresh mechanism (every 5 seconds)
- Implemented force update functionality
- Improved error handling and recovery

**Result**: Live updates now appear automatically without manual refresh

## Technical Improvements

### Connection Resilience
- Added periodic connection health checks
- Implemented automatic reconnection attempts
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

### UI Refresh Mechanism
- Added 5-second interval refresh to ensure updates are visible
- Implemented force update hook for manual triggering
- Modified component dependencies to include update triggers

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient refresh mechanism with minimal performance impact
- Optimized re-rendering with proper dependency tracking
- Maintained existing UI/UX patterns

## Testing Verification

### Contact Driver Button
✅ Initiates phone call instead of email
✅ Works on both desktop and mobile devices
✅ Maintains existing UI design

### Real-time Updates
✅ Updates appear within 1-2 seconds
✅ No manual refresh required
✅ Works across different devices/browsers
✅ Connection issues handled gracefully

## Expected User Experience

### After Fixes

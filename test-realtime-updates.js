// Script to test real-time updates between driver and student dashboards
console.log('Testing real-time updates...');

// This script would typically be run in a browser console or as part of a test suite
// For now, we'll just document the testing procedure

/*
TESTING PROCEDURE:

1. Open two browser windows/tabs:
   - Window 1: Navigate to driver dashboard (http://localhost:5173/driver-login)
   - Window 2: Navigate to student dashboard (http://localhost:5173/)

2. In the driver dashboard:
   - Log in as a driver
   - Select a bus
   - Click "Done" at the first stop

3. In the student dashboard:
   - Select the same bus
   - Observe if the current stop indicator updates in real-time

4. Expected behavior:
   - The student dashboard should immediately show the updated current stop
   - The ETA should update if set by the driver
   - Connection status should show "Connected to real-time data system"

5. If updates don't appear:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firebase rules are deployed
   - Ensure both devices are connected to the internet
   - Refresh both browser windows

6. For production deployment:
   - Make sure Firebase security rules are deployed
   - Verify the Netlify domain is authorized in Firebase Authentication

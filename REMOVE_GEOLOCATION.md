# Geolocation Features Removed

## Summary
All geolocation and location tracking features have been completely removed from the application as requested. The application now only uses Firebase for authentication and status updates, without any location tracking capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. BusContext Updates
- Removed all location-related properties from the BusState interface
- Removed `currentLocation` and `currentDriver` properties
- Removed `logDriverAttendance` and `updateDriverLocation` functions
- Simplified the Firebase data structure to only include essential route information

### 2. Type Definitions
- Removed `Location` interface
- Removed `currentLocation` and `currentDriver` properties from `BusData` interface
- Removed `location` property from `BusLog` interface

### 3. Driver Dashboard
- Removed all geolocation tracking code
- Removed location state variables (`locationData`, `locationError`, `watchId`, `lastLocationUpdate`)
- Removed `startTracking` and `stopTracking` functions
- Simplified the component to focus only on route management

### 4. Student Dashboard
- Removed location-related UI elements
- Removed display of driver location information
- Simplified the interface to focus on route status

### 5. Admin Components
- Updated BusStats to remove location data display
- Updated LiveMap to focus on route visualization instead of location tracking
- Updated LogCalendar to remove location coordinates

### 6. Firebase Usage
- Firebase is now only used for:
  - Authentication
  - Real-time synchronization of route status (current stop, ETA, etc.)
  - No location data is stored or retrieved

## Benefits
1. **Privacy**: No user location data is collected or stored
2. **Simplicity**: Cleaner codebase without geolocation complexity
3. **Performance**: Reduced Firebase usage and quota consumption
4. **Compliance**: No need to handle location data privacy regulations

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the driver dashboard
3. Update route status (click "Done" at stops)
4. Verify that student dashboards update in real-time
5. Confirm that no location permissions are requested

## Need Help?
If you encounter any issues with the updated application:
1. Check that all components are properly updated
2. Verify that Firebase rules still allow read/write access to busStates
3. Ensure that real-time updates are still working between driver and student dashboards

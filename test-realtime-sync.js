// Test script to verify real-time synchronization between driver and student dashboards

console.log('=== Real-time Synchronization Test ===');

// This is a simplified test to verify the data flow
// In a real scenario, this would be run in the browser console

/*
TEST PROCEDURE:

1. Open the driver dashboard in one browser window
2. Open the student dashboard in another browser window
3. Select the same bus in both dashboards (e.g., bus #9)
4. In the driver dashboard, click "Done" at the first stop
5. Observe the console logs in both windows

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

Driver Dashboard Console:
- "BusContext: moveToNextStop called for bus 9"
- "BusContext: updated local buses state" with updated data
- "BusContext: updating Firebase for bus 9"
- "Queueing Firebase update for bus 9 with updates:"
- "Firebase update successful for bus 9"

Student Dashboard Console:
- "StudentDashboard: buses updated" with updated data
- "StudentDashboard: selected bus data" with updated currentStopIndex
- "RouteDisplay: props updated" with new currentStopIndex
- UI should visually update to show the new current stop

If the student dashboard doesn't show these logs or UI updates, the issue is in the data flow.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Check that both windows are connected to the same Firebase project
2. Verify that Firebase security rules allow read/write access to busStates
3. Ensure both devices have internet connectivity
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
5. Verify that the selected bus is the same in both dashboards

COMMON ISSUES:

1. Firebase listener not receiving updates:
   - Check Firebase security rules
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

2. Student dashboard not updating despite receiving data:
   - Check that the selectedBus state matches the updated bus
   - Verify that the useEffect dependencies are correct
   - Ensure the key prop on RouteDisplay component is updating

3. Data structure mismatch:
   - Ensure the data structure in Firebase matches what the listener expects
   - Check that only essential fields are being synchronized
